# Preface 
This section of the book lays the philosophical underpinnings, motivational groundwork, intentions and how to go about comprehending the contents of this book.






## Part 1 
This part of the book is a self contained on that is a non-technical explanation of the history, the concepts and the applications of DL to Machine Vision, Speech and Comprehension. Folks reading this book could stop here and still have a broad high level understanding of DL as a whole. Part 1 has 4 chapters



### Chapter 1 - Vision

This chapter deals with vision and is focused on conveying a high-level understanding of what deep learning is in the context of vision. The vision analogy provides insight into how deep learning approaches are so powerful and so broadly applicable.



### Chapter 2 - Language

This chapter builds atop our deep learning foundations  via the vision analogy and examines how deep learning is incorporated into human language applications, with a particular emphasis on how it can automatically learn features that represents the meaning of words.



### Chapter 3 - Thought

This chapter, introduce some of the concepts that enable deep learning models to create art, an intrinsically human, expression of a creative thought process (like music). It covers the high-level concepts behind GANs, and  the novel visual works they can produce. It also establishes the connection between the latent spaces associated with GANs and the word-vector spaces associated with language models.



### Chapter 4 - Action 

This chapter explains deep reinforcement learning that has produced some of the most surprising artificial-neural-network advances, involving AI breakthroughs of recent years in a very human activity i.e. game playing and intelligently interacting with the environment around them. It explains what reinforcement learning (RL) & how RLâ€™s fusion with deep learning has enabled machines to meet or surpass human-level performance on a diverse range of complex challenges in games, and physical-manipulation tasks.




## Part 2: DL - From Code to Theory:  


Part 1 provided a high-level overview of deep learning we sprinkled with foundational  concepts from its hierarchical, representation-learning nature through to its relationship to the field of artificial intelligence.  Part II of the book gets into the low-level theory and mathematics behind in as simple language as possible with iPython notebooks to back the theory up. Readers can start & stop at Part 2 and have a detailed comprehension of DL.



### Chapter 5 - NN Code

Line-by-line walk-through of a python notebook featuring a neural network model with minimal  theory underpinning the code to make an abstract idea concrete.





### Chapter 6 - NN Theory 

Dives into the nitty-gritty theory underlying ANNs  introduced in Chapter 5. Explains  math basics of artificial neurons,  shallow artificial neural networks and  deep networks.



### Chapter 7 - Shallow NN

We cover, in detail, how individual neural units are linked together to form artificial neural networks and build a feed forward shallow NN  to detect images using MNIST data.



### Chapter 8 - Deep NN

Introduces gradient descent and back-propagation and applies these concepts s to  construct a deep neural network with more than one hidden layer.



### Chapter 9 - Advanced Deep NN 

Discusses technical issues involved in the creation of high-performing neural networks, techniques that overcome them, applies these in code to architecting a production grade  deep neural network.



## Part 3 - Deep Applications:

Work through a set of application areas involving vision, language, thought and action  via hands-on example code including convolutional neural networks and apply them to machine vision tasks, Recurrent neural networks for natural language processing, Generative adversarial networks for visual creativity,  Deep reinforcement learning for sequential decision making within complex, changing environments.



### Chapter 10 - CNN and machine vision application

CNN, Pooling, LeNet5, AlexNet, VGGNet, Tensorflow, Keras, DL Vision App



### Chapter 11 - RNN and NLP

Word2Vec, Classification, RNN, LSTM, etc, Keras, TF,  NLP application



### Chapter 12 - GAN

GAN basics, Dataset, Discriminator, Generator, Adversary, GAN application



### Chapter 13: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

## Part 4 - Architecting Deep Systems

Talks about the intersection of CS, Data Science & Architecture. Goes into Microservices, Cloud, Containers, Distributed Systems, AIaaS, Innovative DL based Projects and Frameworks.
