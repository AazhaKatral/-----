## Table of Contents:
## Preface: 
This section of the book lays the motivational groundwork for this book, what its intentions are and how to go about comprehending the contents of this book

# ____________________________________________________________________
## Part 1 - Concepts:
This part of the book is a self contained one that explains the history, the concepts, the intuitions and the applications of DL to Machine Vision, Speech, Comprehension, Art, Music and Games 

### Chapter 1 - Vision
This chapter deals with vision and is focused on conveying a high-level understanding of what deep learning is in the context of vision. The vision analogy provides insight into how deep learning approaches are so powerful and so broadly applicable.

### Chapter 2 - Language
This chapter builds atop our deep learning foundations  via the vision analogy and examines how deep learning is incorporated into human language applications, with a particular emphasis on how it can automatically learn features that represents the meaning of words.

### Chapter 3 - Art
This chapter, introduce some of the concepts that enable deep learning models to create art and intrinsically human, creative activity. It covers the high-level concepts behind GANs, and  the novel visual works they can produce. It also establishes the connection between the latent spaces associated with GANs and the word-vector spaces associated with language models.

### Chapter 4 - Music
This chapter, introduce some of the concepts that enable deep learning models to create art and intrinsically human, creative activity. It covers the high-level concepts behind GANs, and  the novel visual works they can produce. It also establishes the connection between the latent spaces associated with GANs and the word-vector spaces associated with language models.

### Chapter 5 - Games
This chapter explains deep reinforcement learning that has produced some of the most surprising artificial-neural-network advances, involving AI breakthroughs of recent years in a very human activity i.e. playing games and interacting with the environment around them. It explains what reinforcement learning (RL) & how RLâ€™s fusion with deep learning has enabled machines to meet or surpass human-level performance on a diverse range of complex challenges in games, and physical-manipulation tasks.

## Part 2: DL - Code & Theory:  
Part 1 provided a high-level overview of deep learning we sprinkled with foundational  concepts from its hierarchical, representation-learning nature through to its relationship to the field of artificial intelligence.  Part II of the book we dive into the low-level theory and mathematics behind in as simple language as possible with iPython notebooks to reify the theory.

### Chapter 6 - NN Code
Line-by-line walk-through of a python notebook featuring a neural network model with the theory underpinning the code to make an abstract ideas concrete.

### Chapter 7 - NN Theory 
Dives into the nitty-gritty theory underlying ANNs  introduced in Chapter 6. Explains  math basics of artificial neurons,  shallow artificial neural networks and  deep networks.

### Chapter 8 - Shallow NN
We cover, in detail, how individual neural units are linked together to form artificial neural networks and build a feed forward shallow NN  to detect images using MNIST data.

### Chapter 9 - Deep NN
Introduces gradient descent and back-propagation and applies these concepts s to  construct a deep neural network with more than one hidden layer.

### Chapter 10 - Advanced Deep NN 
Discusses technical issues involved in the creation of high-performing neural networks, techniques that overcome them, applies these in code to architecting a production grade  deep neural network.
